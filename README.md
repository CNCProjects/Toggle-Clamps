Toggle-Clamps
=============

Make Toggle Clamps on your Handibot. CLAMP ALL THE THINGS!

This is a toggle clamp that you can use to clamp things on your bench, in jigs, or just about anywhere you can shoot
a screw or a bolt.

They are sized to be cut on the Handibot in one shot. I've got these all over my shop now for clamping all kinds of things.

Thanks to Bill Young!

Included in is a Sketchup file, and a VCarve file. Just set the thickness you want in VCarve and you're off!
